			<h2>About me:</h2>
			<p>I was born and raised in Wolverhampton in the West Midlands UK, and moved to Vancouver Canada at 13. After graduating from high school from Matthew McNair, I then went on to major in psychology at Langara College and then transferred to the University of British Columbia. After graduating with my BA, I attended Vancouver Film School and studied screenwriting.<br><br>

Soon after leaving film school I lived and worked in Japan for seven years as an English teacher. I started teaching English at a private language school and then later moved on to teaching at Waseda University in Tokyo. Since leaving Japan, I have moved back and forth between the UK, Vancouver and South Korea, and have worked in quite a varied number of roles, everything from English teacher, martial arts instructor, film crew PA, background performer, to prison guard. I am currently enrolled in a distance learning MA for Creative Writing at Lancaster University, and expect to graduate in September 2020. I recently completed my first novel.<br><br>

I started coding BASIC as a child on my ZX Spectrum, and have been interested in all things IT ever since. Through Mayden Academy's full stack bootcamp, I hope to change careers and become a Junior Developer full time in the near future.
